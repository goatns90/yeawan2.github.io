Particulate matter, including airborne pathogens, is of particular concern because it can cause the spread of diseases through aerosol transmission. In response to COVID-19 pandemic, our team proposed a new concept of electrostatic precipitators: on-demand antiviral/antibacterial electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) with electrothermal-based antimicrobial surfaces. We applied electrothermal-based antimicrobial surfaces to ESPs and demonstrated that the efficacy of proposed method in terms of collection and inactivation of airborne pathogen. The electrothermal carbon sucface could effectively collect the bioaerosols as collection plates of ESPs and inactivate the collected microorganisms by joule-heating effect. <p>
