A novel electrostatic precipitator (ESP)-type small air purifier with an ion spray charger was developed and evaluated. Unlike conventional ESP air purifiers, the charger is located at the outlet where clean air is released. Ions are emitted into ambient space by the fan of the air purifier, and airborne particles are charged by nearby ions through a diffusion charging mechanism. A carbon fiber ionizer without a grounded metal plate was installed as the charger to minimize ozone emission. Through this simple change in structure, the clean air delivery rate (CADR) of the novel air purifier was enhanced while emitting negligible ozone of 1.3 ppb for 12 h. This techonology is transfered to Century Co., Ltd and being commercialized.

ESPs can effectively remove PM2.5 with a low pressure drop, resulting in an energy-efficient air quality management system compared to filters. However, the ozone emissions from ESPs hinder their use for indoor air purification.In a building environment. Therefore, I developed low-ozone emission and highly integrated ESPs and its regeneration system for building environment. Carbon fiber ionizers were adopted in a pre-charger to reduce ozone generation and carbon coated plastics were used to reduce weight and installation cost. Our team demonstrated field study through retrofitting heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) systems of subway stations by our novel ESPs. <p>
