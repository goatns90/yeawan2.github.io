Ambient air pollution is a critical risk factor for human diseases. Despite advances in aerosol sensor technology, accurate measurement of aeorosol mass concentration still depends on gravimetric method by measuring weight of filters after sampling large volume of air. In this study, I am developing a **real-time aersol mass sensing system** based on a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) that can accurately measure the fine mass of airborne particles. I designed inertial impactors to separate particles by size, enabling direct measurement of PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 using QCM.  <p>
