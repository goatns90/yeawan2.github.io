In a wet scrubber, the polluted gas stream is brought into contact with the scrubbing liquid, by spraying it with the liquid to remove the pollutants, including gases, and particles. To control anthropogenic sources of NOx from flue gas, the selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) or selective catalytic reduction (SCR) process is generally employed. However, SNCR and SCR requires high temperature over 300 &deg;C. To overcome this limitation, I developed a novel wet scrubber to remove NOx operating in a low-temperature under 50 &deg;C. This technology succeeded in pilot demonstration tests in a steel mill, coal power plant, and semiconductor factory.

An electrostatic precipitator (ESP) removes fine particles by electrically charging particles and collecting them through electrostatic force. ESPs are effective in handling large gas volumes with heavy dust loads. However, industrial ESPs are costly because the exhaust gases of power plants and semiconductor manufacturing plants contain corrosive acid gases, as well as particulate matters. Therefore, I developed highly efficient, corrosion-resistant two-
stage ESP using carbon-based plastic collection plates. The plastic plates not only economical and anti-corrosive, but also improved electrical stabiltiy of the ESP preventing abnormal sparks even in extremely humid environment. This technology succeeded in pilot demonstration tests in a coal power plant.
