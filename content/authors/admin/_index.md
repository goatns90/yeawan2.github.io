I am currently a researcher in department of urban environment research at the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM), a journey I embarked on in 2019.12. Before I join KIMM, I received a M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials [(advisor: Prof. Hyoungsoo Kim)](https://hyoungsookimm.wixsite.com/filkaist).

My primary interest lies in developing practical solutions for sampling, removing, and sensing airborne pollutants. I developed **air pollution control devices** including *electrostatic precipitators* and *scrubbers* for semiconductor industries, power plants, and buildings. During COVID-19 pandemic, I developed antimicrobial electrostatic precipitator for airborne pathogen disinfection. Currently, I am developing **real-time aerosol mass balance**, and air purifying **ionic fan**. <p>

**Technical skills**
- **MATLAB and PYTHON** for programming and image analysis
- High speed imaging 
- **CATIA** for 3D CAD and **KEYSHOT** for rendering
- **ANSYS FLUENT** and **COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS** for CFD
- Various aerosol measurement devices **APS, SMPS, OPC, ELPI, etc.** 
- Gas analyzers by means of **FT-IR (MIDAC)** and **elecrochemical cells (MRU)**
