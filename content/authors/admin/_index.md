I am currently a PhD student in Prof. Yongjie Hu's group of University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), a journey I embarked in 2025.09. Before I started ths PhD course, I was employed in department of urban environment research at the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials (KIMM). I received a M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from KAIST [(advisor: Prof. Hyoungsoo Kim)](https://hyoungsookimm.wixsite.com/filkaist).

My primary interest lies in developing practical solutions for sampling, removing, and sensing airborne pollutants. I developed **air pollution control devices** including *electrostatic precipitators* and *scrubbers* for semiconductor industries, power plants, and buildings. During COVID-19 pandemic, I developed antimicrobial electrostatic precipitator for airborne pathogen disinfection. Currently, I am investigating **high thermal conductivity semiconductors**. <p>

**Technical skills**
- Material synthesis and analysis including Raman, SEM, XRD, etc.
- **MATLAB and PYTHON** for programming and image analysis
- Flow visualtization
- **CATIA** for 3D CAD and **KEYSHOT** for rendering
- **ANSYS FLUENT** and **COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS** for CFD
- Various aerosol measurement devices **APS, SMPS, OPC, ELPI, etc.**
