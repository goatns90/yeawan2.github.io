The interaction between engineered surfaces is an essential element in modern technology and industry, and understanding this interaction is key to unlocking new technological innovations. My research focuses on the phenomena arising from the **physical contact between two engineered surfaces**. The goal is to develop processing technologies that can create high-value, innovative products by precisely manipulating phenomena such as friction, wear, polishing, diffusion, adhesion, and deformation.

I am currently a Ph.D. student in [Professor Sanha Kim's group (Advanced Manufacturing and Surface Engineering (AMSE) Laboratory)](https://amselab.kaist.ac.kr/home) at the [Department of Mechanical Engineering, KAIST](https://me.kaist.ac.kr/eng/main/main.html), a journey I embarked on in 2020. In 2019, as an undergraduate at [Hanyang University](https://me.hanyang.ac.kr/?passedIntro=true&lang=eng), I conducted graduation research in [Professor Se-Jin Yook's group](http://entel.hanyang.ac.kr/board/bbs/board.php?bo_table=Main). This academic journey has engaged me in various research projects within the field of mechanical engineering, enabling me to develop profound expertise and technical skills.
