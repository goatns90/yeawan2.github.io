# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research focuses on the phenomena arising from the physical contact between two engineered surfaces. The goal is to develop processing technologies that can create high-value, innovative products by precisely manipulating phenomena such as friction, wear, polishing, diffusion, adhesion, and deformation.

In pursuit of technologies that can extend human lifespan, we can develop implantable medical devices aimed at dramatically increasing lifespan, or prevent a decrease in lifespan by preparing for a pandemic. However, the development of these two technologies is currently limited due to the lack of suitable energy sources. A triboelectric generator, which allows for considerable freedom in material selection, can address the energy requirements of both technologies. **Here, we have improved the output of the triboelectric generator through the development of material and structural modifications and investigated its potential as a power source for implantable medical devices and pathogen control technology such as those for viruses and bacteria**.

I am currently a Postdoctral Fellow in [Advanced Functional Polymers Center (advisor: Dr. Yun Ho Kim)](https://sites.google.com/view/krict-polymer) at the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, a journey I embarked on in 2023. Before I join KRICT, I got Ph.D at Sungkyunkwan University, and my Supervisor was [Professor Sang-Woo Kim](https://ehl.yonsei.ac.kr/).
